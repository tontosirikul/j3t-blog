  Introduction
  <a class="anchor" href="#introduction">#</a>
</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm about to finish my bachelor‚Äôs degree in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence in the next two months. The past few months have been a rollercoaster‚Äîranging from regretting the value of my degree to considering a complete career shift.</p>
<p>This blog is my reflection on that journey and a breakdown of what comes next.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="lets-talk-about-my-degree-disappointment">
  Let&rsquo;s talk about my degree disappointment.
  <a class="anchor" href="#lets-talk-about-my-degree-disappointment">#</a>
</h2>
<p>I originally pursued this degree with the hope of becoming a robotics software engineer. Unfortunately, the reality didn‚Äôt match my expectations. Many modules suffered from poor instruction, lack of guidance, and an incoherent syllabus. As a result, I didn&rsquo;t gain the solid foundation needed to become a job-ready robotics engineer.</p>
<p>On the bright side, a few AI and data-related modules‚Äîmostly offered by other departments‚Äîwere useful. While theory-heavy and lacking in hands-on practice, they still helped me understand the broader landscape of Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p>Because the university fell short in teaching practical skills, I turned to external resources like Udacity, Skooldio, and Coursera. I poured my energy into self-study and eventually asked my cooperative education supervisors to let me focus solely on software development, with only a bit of machine learning work.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs when I realized that computer science, software engineering, or general software development could be another viable path. But one big question remained: how could I compete with students who had actually studied those subjects? After all, my degree included just one computer programming module. And when it comes to robotics, how can I compete with graduates from better universities?</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="passion-is-not-working-in-this-cruel-world">
  Passion is not working in this cruel world.
  <a class="anchor" href="#passion-is-not-working-in-this-cruel-world">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Even though I have much passion for the robotics field, the only thing I can offer to the world (I mean the employees) is software development. I have two choices to decide.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Take a degree in what I have a passion for (MSc robotics), even if It is my weakness. I cannot guarantee on this choice that improving my weakness gonna get me a job. Still, it&rsquo;s definitely fulfilling my lack of passion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take a degree in what I am already good at (MSc computer science/software development) and progress to become great. I had made money from taking a part-time freelance as a front-end developer. My supervisors at cooperative study wanted me to join his team as a software developer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Passion is not from what you want to do (What can the world do for me); it is from your mastery (what you can do and offer to the world).</p></blockquote>
<p>I can&rsquo;t take any more of a lost year of creating a new skill. I would instead strengthen my already existing skill.</p>
<p>Finally, I decided to prepare myself for the software development field by pursuing the MSc in Software development/Computer science. This type of MSc is a conversion program that takes people not studying computer science to become job-ready (?) software developers. (Sound like a premium Bootcamp). And It&rsquo;s easy to change into the robotics field later. At least I can get money from this choice</p>
<p>You may have a question about why I don&rsquo;t become a self-taught developer and get a job?</p>
<p>This can simply be answered as I already had a plan to take MSc 5 years ago (Sponsored by my parent). It&rsquo;s not just pop up at the end of my BSc. The thing that I have to decide is what to study for.</p>
<p>Since I have this unfair advantage to get another degree, there is no reason why I have to become a self-taught developer? Easy right.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="real-world-lesson">
  Real-world lesson
  <a class="anchor" href="#real-world-lesson">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Yes, it sounds like MSc solved everything, but my family&rsquo;s money on BSc was gone. And I have to plus the loss with Msc tuition fee. If I knew that I would end up like this, I would pursue another Bsc degree from other schools and save over a million Thai baht.</p>
<p>All I can feel right now is I&rsquo;m just regretting it.</p>
<p>But the regretting thing that happened is not making me advanced. This BSc would be my best decision at that time. No one can predict the future. I learned that the university would not take responsibility for this; it is still my responsibility to take their result and move on. No matter many I regret, the university is still the same;</p>
<p>Also, I can&rsquo;t expect much about my upcoming MSc; it may be like my BSc, and everything outside my control is unreliable. All I can do is rely only on myself, become self-learning, improve myself, and don&rsquo;t give any second to give a *** about it.</p>

  Wrapping up

</h2>
<p>I hope all the readers do not get a terrible Bsc experience like me. If that happens to you, trust me to take it as your responsibility and create a solid plan for yourself.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading until this.</p>
