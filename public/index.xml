      <description>&lt;h2 class=&#34;heading&#34; id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&#xA;  Introduction&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#introduction&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been working at ExxonMobil for about six months now as a new graduate developer. I‚Äôm currently the sole developer maintaining our team‚Äôs services. For most of that time, things had been running smoothly. There were no incidents, and I felt fairly confident keeping everything stable. That changed when a production issue occurred‚Äîone that didn‚Äôt directly involve my part of the system, but it still put me in a position where I had to step up. It was a moment that made me realise just how much I didn‚Äôt know‚Äîand pushed me to grow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 class=&#34;heading&#34; id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&#xA;  Introduction&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#introduction&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm about to finish my bachelor‚Äôs degree in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence in the next two months. The past few months have been a rollercoaster‚Äîranging from regretting the value of my degree to considering a complete career shift.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This blog is my reflection on that journey and a breakdown of what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;heading&#34; id=&#34;lets-talk-about-my-degree-disappointment&#34;&gt;&#xA;  Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about my degree disappointment.&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#lets-talk-about-my-degree-disappointment&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I originally pursued this degree with the hope of becoming a robotics software engineer. Unfortunately, the reality didn‚Äôt match my expectations. Many modules suffered from poor instruction, lack of guidance, and an incoherent syllabus. As a result, I didn&amp;rsquo;t gain the solid foundation needed to become a job-ready robotics engineer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I graduated from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kmitl.ac.th&#34;&gt;KMITL&lt;/a&gt; in 2022 with a BEng in Robotics and AI, then continued my studies at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gla.ac.uk&#34;&gt;University of Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;, earning a degree MSc in Software Development in 2023. Since 2024, I‚Äôve been working as a software engineer at &lt;a href=&#34;https://corporate.exxonmobil.com&#34;&gt;ExxonMobil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I discovered my passion for software development during an internship at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scg.com&#34;&gt;SCG&lt;/a&gt;, where I had the chance to work on factory production monitoring system as software developer and collaborate with experienced AI and IoT engineers. That experience sparked my curiosity and motivated me to pursue a master‚Äôs degree to deepen my understanding and expand my skills.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
