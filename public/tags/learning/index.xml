      <description>&lt;h2 class=&#34;heading&#34; id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&#xA;  Introduction&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#introduction&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been working at ExxonMobil for about six months now as a new graduate developer. I‚Äôm currently the sole developer maintaining our team‚Äôs services. For most of that time, things had been running smoothly. There were no incidents, and I felt fairly confident keeping everything stable. That changed when a production issue occurred‚Äîone that didn‚Äôt directly involve my part of the system, but it still put me in a position where I had to step up. It was a moment that made me realise just how much I didn‚Äôt know‚Äîand pushed me to grow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 class=&#34;heading&#34; id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;&#xA;  Introduction&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#introduction&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm about to finish my bachelor‚Äôs degree in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence in the next two months. The past few months have been a rollercoaster‚Äîranging from regretting the value of my degree to considering a complete career shift.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This blog is my reflection on that journey and a breakdown of what comes next.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 class=&#34;heading&#34; id=&#34;lets-talk-about-my-degree-disappointment&#34;&gt;&#xA;  Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about my degree disappointment.&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#lets-talk-about-my-degree-disappointment&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I originally pursued this degree with the hope of becoming a robotics software engineer. Unfortunately, the reality didn‚Äôt match my expectations. Many modules suffered from poor instruction, lack of guidance, and an incoherent syllabus. As a result, I didn&amp;rsquo;t gain the solid foundation needed to become a job-ready robotics engineer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
