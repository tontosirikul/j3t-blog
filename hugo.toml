Iâ€™m Ton, also known as Jake â€” just two names for the same person. 
I'm a software engineer, partly because I enjoy solving problems â€” and partly because it covers the bills and feeds me.

This blog isnâ€™t just about what I learn as a developer â€” itâ€™s also a space where I share my thoughts, experiences, and reflections on life. Whether itâ€™s tech, travel, or everyday moments, I write to connect, reflect, and occasionally make sense of it all.
